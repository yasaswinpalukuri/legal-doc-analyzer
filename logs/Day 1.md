### 🗓️ Daily Log – Day 1  
**Date:** July 22, 2025  
**Project:** AI-powered Legal Document Analyzer  
**Team Member:** Yasaswin Palukuri  

#### ✅ Tasks Completed:
- 🔹 Initialized Git repository locally and on GitHub ([link](https://github.com/yasaswinpalukuri/legal-doc-analyzer))
- 🔹 Created and committed project scaffolding files:
  - `.gitignore`
  - `LICENSE (MIT)`
  - `README.md`
  - `CHANGELOG.md`
- 🔹 Connected remote origin and successfully pushed to `main` branch

#### 🧠 Learnings:
- Recalled `git remote add`, `git push -u origin main`, and dealing with `refspec` errors
- Understood importance of boilerplate files for open-source/commercial readiness
- Used ChatGPT to auto-generate clean starter documentation for project maintainability

#### ⚠️ Roadblocks:
- Initial push failed due to missing branch (`main`) — resolved by committing changes first

#### 🧭 Next Steps:
- Start building minimal working prototype:
  - Load PDF/Docx legal files
  - Extract and preprocess text using NLP (spaCy or transformers)
  - Identify and annotate legal clauses
- Define tasks in GitHub Issues and project board
